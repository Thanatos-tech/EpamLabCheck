The more things change
The more things change
Ain稚 it funny how
Apparently everything is the same
Ain稚 it funny how
I think I知 waking up
I think I知 waking up or I'm about to be
I think I'm waking up
And now I知 breaking up or so I ought to be
I think I知 breaking up
Let it go

I知 falling away from my world of destruction
I知 falling away from the pain
