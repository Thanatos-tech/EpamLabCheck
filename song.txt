Falling away


The more things change
The more things change
Ain’t it funny how
Apparently everything is the same
Ain’t it funny how
I think I’m waking up
I think I’m waking up or I'm about to be
I think I'm waking up
And now I’m breaking up or so I ought to be
I think I’m breaking up
Let it go

I’m falling away from my world of destruction
I’m falling away from the pain

Ain’t it funny how
The more things change
The more things change
Ain’t it funny how
I think it’s shaping up
I think it’s shaping up or it's about to be
I think it's shaping up
And now it’s breaking up or gonna set me free
I think it’s breaking
Breaking up

I’m falling away from my world of destruction
I’m falling away from the pain

We all fall down

I’m falling away
Ain’t it funny how
I’m falling away
Ain’t it funny how

I’m falling away from my world of destruction
I’m falling away from the pain
